<h1>Angular</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Angular is a platform and framework for building client-side, single-page
  applications (SPAs: a web application that loads a single HTML page and
  dynamically updates the content of that page as the user interacts with it )
  using HTML and TypeScript. Developed and maintained by Google, it provides a
  structured approach to building complex, dynamic web applications with a focus
  on modularity( breaking down a large program into smaller), reusability, and
  maintainability (process of modifying, updating, or adapting a software)
</p>

<h2>Difference between Angular and React</h2>
<p>
  Angular is a complete framework with a structured, opinionated approach to web
  development. React is a JavaScript library focused on building user
  interfaces.
</p>
<p>
  Angular is like a blueprint for building a house; it gives you a clear plan
  and all the tools. React is like a toolkit for building a house; it gives you
  great tools for specific tasks, but you have to come up with the plan
  yourself.
</p>

<h3>Why Angular?</h3>
<p>
  <b>Structure:</b> It provides a consistent, built-in structure for large-scale
  applications, making them easier to manage and scale. <b>TypeScript:</b> It
  uses TypeScript by default, which adds type safety and helps catch errors
  early. <b>"Batteries Included":</b> Angular includes everything you need out
  of the box—routing, state management, and an efficient command-line interface
  (CLI).
</p>

<h3>Versions Of Angular</h3>
<p>
  Angular versions are released on a six-month schedule. Currently there are 20
  versions in Angular. First vversion is developed using JS and it is known as
  AngularJs and after that all version are build using TS only
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites needed for angular</h2>
<p>
  <b>Node.js & npm:</b> Angular runs on Node.js and uses its package manager,
  npm, to install all the necessary dependencies. You'll need to have a recent,
  stable version of Node.js installed on your system. npm -> " It's the standard
  tool for managing JavaScript packages and is the default package manager for
  Node.js. "
</p>
<p>
  <b>IDE(Integrated Development Environment)(Code-Editor):</b> You'll need a
  good code editor with solid support for Angular, TypeScript, and debugging.
  Visual Studio Code is the most popular choice as it has excellent extensions
  specifically for Angular.
</p>
<p>
  <b>AngularCLI :</b>"The main work of the Angular CLI is to automate and
  streamline the entire development workflow". The CLI automates the creation of
  a new Angular project with a single command (ng new my-app). This sets up all
  the necessary files, configurations, and dependencies, saving you hours of
  manual work. It can quickly generate core building blocks like components,
  services, and modules using simple commands (ng generate component
  my-component). This ensures a consistent project structure and saves you from
  manually creating and linking files.The CLI is integrated with testing
  frameworks, allowing you to run unit and end-to-end tests with simple commands
</p>
<p>
  To install AngularCLI the command is "npm install -g angular/cliversion_num"
  (here '-g' indicated it is installed globally )
</p>
<p>
  <b>NPM :</b>Node Package Manager, is the world's largest software registry and
  a command-line tool for managing JavaScript packages.It allows developers to
  easily share, discover, and use pre-written code packages to speed up their
  development process.
</p>

<h4>Components</h4>
<p>
  A Component is the basic building block of an Angular application that
  controls a section of the user interface.It has three parts: a class (for
  logic), a template (for HTML view), and styles (for design). The Component
  decorator tells Angular how to use it. Every app has one main component called
  AppComponent, and more components can be added to make the app organized and
  reusable.
</p>
<p>It contains mainly 4 main parts</p>
<ul>
  <li>Html Component</li>
  <li>css Component</li>
  <li>spects.ts component</li>
  <li>ts component</li>
</ul>

<h3>App Component</h3>
<p>
  It's the main component in a angular file.The AppComponent is the root
  component of every Angular application. It is the first component that loads
  when the app starts and acts as the main container for the whole application.
  All other components are either directly or indirectly children of the
  AppComponent. It is defined in the app-component-ts file, and it uses an HTML
  template (app-component-html) and styles (app-component-css). The selector for
  AppComponent is usually "app-root", which is placed inside the index.html file
  to display the Angular app in the browser. In short, AppComponent is the entry
  point and backbone of an Angular application.
</p>

<h4>Type Script Based</h4>
<p>
  Angular is built on TypeScript because it provides features that plain
  JavaScript lacks, such as type safety, classes, interfaces, and better tooling
  support. These features help developers catch errors early, write cleaner
  code, and build large, complex applications more easily and reliably.Also
  Helps in error detection at compile time and makes code more scalable.
  TypeScript also compiles down to JavaScript, so Angular apps can run in any
  browser.
</p>
<p>
  TypeScript → JavaScript → Browser’s JS Engine → Machine Code (Binary) → CPU
  Execution
</p>

<h4>Angular Project Structure</h4>
<p>
  >When you create a new project using ng new, Angular generates a folder
  structure:
</p>
<p>src-app → contains modules, components, services</p>
<p>main-ts → entry point that bootstraps the app</p>
<p>index-html → root HTML file where app-root is placed</p>
<p>angular-json → config file for build & project settings</p>
<p>package-json → dependencies and npm scripts</p>

<h2>Structure of an Angular Project</h2>
<p>
  When we create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI command
  <b>ng new project-name</b>, it automatically generates a standard folder
  structure. This structure helps in organizing files and makes the development
  process easier and more scalable.
</p>

<h3>Main Folders and Files</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>e2e/</b> → Contains end-to-end test files to test the application flow as
    a whole.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>node_modules/</b> → Contains all project dependencies and packages
    installed through npm.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>src/</b> → The main source folder where the actual application code
    resides.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>app/</b> → Contains the core of the application such as modules,
        components, and services.
        <ul>
          <li><b>app.component.ts</b> → Logic of the root component.</li>
          <li>
            <b>app.component.html</b> → Template (UI) of the root component.
          </li>
          <li><b>app.component.css</b> → Styling of the root component.</li>
          <li>
            <b>app.module.ts</b> → Root module that bootstraps the application.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>assets/</b> → Stores static files like images, icons, and JSON data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>environments/</b> → Contains environment-specific configuration files
        (development, production).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>main.ts</b> → The entry point of the Angular app. It bootstraps the
        root module (AppModule).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>index.html</b> → The main HTML file loaded in the browser. The
        Angular app gets displayed inside the <code>&lt;app-root&gt;</code>
        selector here.
      </li>
      <li><b>styles.css</b> → Global stylesheet for the entire project.</li>
      <li><b>polyfills.ts</b> → Provides compatibility for older browsers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuration Files</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>angular.json</b> → Defines project configuration (build settings, styles,
    scripts, assets).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>package.json</b> → Lists project dependencies, scripts, and npm commands.
  </li>
  <li><b>tsconfig.json</b> → TypeScript configuration file.</li>
  <li><b>karma.conf.js</b> → Configuration file for running unit tests.</li>
  <li>
    <b>tslint.json</b> (or eslint.json in newer versions) → Defines linting
    rules for code quality.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This structure ensures that Angular applications are
  <b>modular, maintainable, and scalable</b>. Developers can easily add new
  components, services, and modules without breaking the organization of the
  project.
