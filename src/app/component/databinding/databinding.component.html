<h1>Data Binding</h1>
<h3>Definition of Data Binding</h3>
<p>
  Data binding is a technique that connects the data in the TypeScript
  (component) with the HTML (view), so that any change in one is immediately
  reflected in the other.It automates the UI update process, making your code
  simpler, more predictable, and easier to maintain. You don't have to manually
  write code to push and pull data between your HTML and your logic.
</p>
<h3>Types of Data Binding</h3>
<p>There are mainly two types of data bindings</p>
<ul>
  <li>One way Data Binding</li>
  <li>Two way Data Binding</li>
</ul>
<img [src]="dataImg" />

<h4>One Way Data Binding</h4>
<p>One way data binding consists of 3 types</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interpolation</li>
  <li>Property Binding</li>
  <li>Event Binding</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interpolation</h3>
<p>
  Interpolation in Angular is a type of one-way data binding that allows you to
  display dynamic data from the component (TypeScript code) into the view (HTML
  template).
</p>
<p>
  It uses the (double curly braces) syntax. Whatever value is written inside the
  curly braces is evaluated by Angular and the result is displayed as text in
  the HTML.It can display variables, expressions, method return values, and even
  perform simple calculations. It cannot change values in the component, it only
  shows them in the template.
</p>
<p>The data flows in only one direction: from the component → to the view.</p>
<p>
  Interpolation = one-way data binding (component → view) using double curly
  braces.
</p>

<h2>Property Binding</h2>
<p>
  Property Binding is a feature in Angular that lets you
  <b>bind component data to HTML element properties</b>. It updates the
  element’s property value whenever the component’s data changes, ensuring that
  the UI always shows the latest data.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;img [src]="imageUrl" &gt;</li>
</ul>
<img
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ddlrkl4jy/image/upload/v1756145823/propertyBinding_adquoj.jpg"
/>
<p>
  In this example, the <b>src</b> property of the image will always display the
  value of <b>imageUrl</b> from the component.
</p>
<p>
  ImgUrl that we are using should be declared in TS file with type string.
  ImgUrl stores the image address, while we are doing bind in output we are not
  getting the img link instead we are getting the direct image i.e, here applies
  the property binding.
</p>
<p>Property Binding → one-way (component → element property)</p>
<p>
  Property Binding = one-way data binding (component → view) by binding data to
  element properties using square brackets [ ]
</p>
<h3>Event Binding</h3>
<p>
  A technique in Angular that allows the view (HTML) to listen to events (like
  clicks, input, or mouse movements) and call a method in the component when the
  event occurs. It’s a one-way binding from view → component.
</p>
<p>
  In this a 'event' is first declared in HTML and then it is called in TS
  component and the required logic will be written there, when the event happens
  the changes will appear in UI
</p>
<p>It connects a user action in the template to a function in the component.</p>
<p>
  Event Binding = one-way data binding (HTML → TS component) using parentheses
  to listen to events, e.g., (click)="methodName()".
</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<img
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ddlrkl4jy/image/upload/v1756146811/eventBinding_nizugw.jpg"
/>
<p>here click should in curved braces like '(click)'</p>
<h2>Two Way Data Binding</h2>
<p>
  Two-way Data Binding is a mechanism that allows synchronization between the
  component and the view. When the data in the component changes, the view
  updates automatically, and when the user changes the data in the view (e.g.,
  typing in an input), the component’s property is updated as well. It combines
  property binding and event binding into a single step using [( )] syntax
  called banana-in-a-box.
</p>
<p>
  This can be achived bu using "ngModel" key word in input tag placing in [( )]
  and assining the value which is declared in TS that have to be modified while
  input tag is getting modified
</p>
<p>It uses the [( )] syntax, called banana-in-a-box.</p>
<p>
  Data Binding is a mechanism to coordinate data between the component and the
  view in Angular. It can be one-way (component → view or view → component) or
  two-way (both ways), allowing automatic updates when data changes.
</p>

  The important thing is while using ngModel it is needed to import is
  'FormsModule' iN TS component

<h5>Live Example of Two-Way Data Binding with Button</h5>

<input
  [(ngModel)]="userEnteredValue"
  type="text"
  placeholder="Enter something"
/>
<button (click)="displayVal()">Display</button>

<p>You typed: {{ displayedValue }}</p>
