<h2>Defintion of Directives</h2>
<p>
  Directives in Angular are special instructions that add custom behavior to
  elements in the DOM. They are used to change the structure, appearance, or
  behavior of HTML elements. Simply, A directive is a class that adds new
  behavior to elements in the template or modifies their structure. Consider
  them as instructions for Angular to manipulate the Document Object Model
  (DOM).
</p>
<h2>Types of Directives</h2>
<Ul>
  <li>Component Directives</li>
  <li>Structural Directives</li>
  <li>Attribute Directives</li>
  <li>Custom Directives</li>
</Ul>
<h3>Component Directives</h3>
<p>
  A component directive in Angular is a TypeScript class decorated with
  Component decorator that combines HTML templates, CSS styles, and business
  logic to create reusable UI elements. Components are the fundamental building
  blocks of Angular applications that control specific parts of the user
  interface and handle user interactions. Component Directives are directives in
  Angular that control a portion of the UI by using their own template, logic,
  and styles. Every Angular component is essentially a component directive.
</p>
<h3>KeyCharacteristics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Encapsulated: Components have their own scope with isolated styles and data
  </li>
  <li>Reusable: Can be used multiple times throughout the application</li>
  <li>Interactive: Handles user events and manages component state</li>
  <li>
    Hierarchical: Components can contain other components forming a
    treestructure
  </li>
  <li>
    Lifecycle-aware: Has built-in lifecycle hooks for initialization and cleanup
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Core Elements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Component Decorator: Contains metadata like selector, template, and styles
  </li>
  <li>
    Selector: CSS selector that identifies how to use the component in templates
  </li>
  <li>
    Template/TemplateUrl: Defines the HTML structure (inline or external file)
  </li>
  <li>
    Styles/StyleUrls: Component-specific CSS styling (inline or external file)
  </li>
  <li>Class Properties: Store component data and state</li>
  <li>Class Methods: Handle component logic and user interactions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lifecycle Hooks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    ngOnInit(): Called after component initialization, ideal for setup logic
  </li>
  <li>ngOnChanges(): Called when input properties change</li>
  <li>ngAfterViewInit(): Called after component's view is fully initialized</li>
  <li>ngOnDestroy(): Called before component destruction, used for cleanup</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Components serve as the foundation of Angular applications, providing a
  structured way to build interactive and maintainable user interfaces while
  promoting code reusability and separation of concerns
</p>
<p>Component itself is a directive, so any component is a example to it</p>
<h3>Structural Directives</h3>
<p>
  Structural directives are Angular directives that change the DOM layout by
  adding, removing, or replacing HTML elements. They are responsible for shaping
  and reshaping the DOM structure based on certain conditions or data.
  Structural directives are easily identified by the asterisk (*) prefix and
  work by manipulating the template structure rather than just modifying element
  properties.Unlike component directives, structural directives don’t have their
  own template or styles. It is shorthand for Angular’s template syntax
  (ng-template).
</p>
<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>DOM Manipulation: Add, remove, or replace elements in the DOM tree</li>
  <li>Asterisk Syntax: Always prefixed with * (e.g., *ngIf, *ngFor)</li>
  <li>
    Template Transformation: Convert the asterisk syntax into >ng-template>
    elements internally
  </li>
  <li>
    Conditional Rendering: Control which parts of the template are rendered
  </li>
  <li>
    Performance Impact: Directly affect rendering performance by changing DOM
    structure
  </li>
  <li>
    Single Usage: Only one structural directive can be applied per element
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Core Elements</h3>
<ul>
  h
  <li>
    TemplateRef:A reference to an Angular >ng-template> that allows the
    framework to access and display its hidden HTML content dynamically in the
    view.
  </li>
  <li>
    ViewContainerRef: Container where the directive can insert, remove, or
    manipulate views
  </li>
  <li>
    Microsyntax: Special Angular syntax that expands into full template notation
  </li>
  <li>Context Object: Data passed to the template for use in expressions</li>
  <li>
    Host Element: The element to which the structural directive is applied
  </li>
</ul>
